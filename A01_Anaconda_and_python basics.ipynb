    "Please be sure to use all of the class resources available\n",
    "* We've tried to schedule the instructor/TA office hours and (informal) recitation to cover most time zones, and failing that you can make an appointment with any of us, or email us directly.\n",
    "* Use the BlackBoard discussion group liberally, and don't be shy about either asking or answering questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program for the first time can (and should) be lots of fun, but it can also be pretty intense. You are literally learning a new language and a new way of algorithmic thinking (though, apparently, when programming you [don't use the same parts of your brain](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215) as you use for human language).\n",

    "If you are finding keeping up in class or keeping up with the homework is taking more time than you think is reasonable please reach out to us.  Everyone progresses at a different pace and the point of this class is to enable you to employ Python and associated tools in your own research and future career, so it's worth taking our time. \n",
